# Harpocrates

> She saw before her bed, or seemed to see as in a dream, great Isis with her train of holy deities. Upon her brow there stood the crescent moon-horns, garlanded with glittering heads of golden grain, and grace of royal dignity; and at her side... the god who holds his finger to his lips for silence's sake."

Harpocrates is a browser plugin that takes the bookmark pain away from you.

# Rationale
A typical user will happily use the standard bookmark manager that comes with each browser, be it Chrome or Firefox. And for most of the time, it fulfills lots of needs a user may have. E.g. saving, organising, searching, etc.

But, at the same time, it also leaves out lots of useful features that an advanced user may want to use. E.g. tagging, securing with a password, adding additional info, etc.

Enter Harpocrates.

Harpocrates is designed to be a replacement for the standard bookmark manager. It offers:
- [ ] Wellknown standard bookmark operations, plus
- [ ] Tagging folders and bookmarks for easy searching & filtering, and
- [ ] Securing folders with a password, and finally
- [ ] Additional info for folders and bookmarks.
